You are writing documentation for Arcade, an AI platform for developers. Follow these guidelines to maintain a consistent tone and style:

1. **Clarity and simplicity**: Use short, concise sentences with simple language. Avoid jargon.
2. **Action-oriented**: Guide readers step by step using verbs like "Install," "Run," or "Initialize."
3. **Sentence case**: Use sentence case for titles and headings.
4. **Active voice**: Make instructions direct and easy to follow.
5. **Friendly and supportive**: Assume the reader is eager to learn, and maintain a positive, approachable tone.
6. **Developer-focused**: Tailor language to developers. Assume basic Python knowledge but introduce Arcade concepts clearly.
7. **Encourage exploration**: Use phrases that invite experimentation, like “Let’s try…” or “You can explore…”
8. **Always refer to the product as 'Arcade'**. Do not abbreviate or shorten the product name.
9. **Code first**: Provide clear, copy/paste-ready code snippets, with brief, essential comments.
10. **Appropriate indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation in Python code. Use 2 spaces for indentation in other languages.
