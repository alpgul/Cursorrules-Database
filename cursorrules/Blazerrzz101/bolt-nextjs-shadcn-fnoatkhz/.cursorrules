# Lessons
## User Specified Lessons
- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When working with Supabase, ensure database types are properly defined in types/supabase.ts before implementing realtime features
- In Next.js, enable ESLint and TypeScript type checking only in development for faster production builds
- Use specific vendor chunks in webpack configuration to optimize bundle sizes for frequently used packages
- When implementing rate limiting in PostgreSQL, use metadata JSONB columns for flexible storage of rate limit data
- When using pgcrypto for hashing, ensure the extension is created in the correct schema and parameters are properly cast
- When modifying existing tables in Supabase migrations, use ALTER TABLE with IF EXISTS checks to prevent errors
- When implementing RLS policies, ensure proper GRANT statements are in place for table access
- When mocking browser APIs in Jest with TypeScript, prefer using `jest.spyOn` over direct mock objects to maintain proper typing
- For localStorage mocks, consider using a combination of `jest.spyOn` and a mock storage object to maintain both type safety and test functionality
- When working with Jest mocks in TypeScript, ensure mock functions are properly typed using `jest.MockedFunction` or `jest.SpyInstance`
- When mocking Supabase in TypeScript tests, consider using a separate mock file with proper type definitions or use partial mocking with jest.spyOn for better type safety
- When working with Supabase Auth, use email as fallback for display name when user_metadata is not available, and ensure proper user profile data is synced with the auth system
- When implementing voting systems with Supabase, use direct database operations instead of RPC functions for better reliability
- Always ensure numeric values are properly handled with helper functions like ensureNumber() to prevent NaN issues
- Store client IDs in metadata JSONB columns for anonymous users instead of separate columns
- Use optimistic UI updates for better user experience, but always verify with server data
- Implement proper error handling and fallbacks in API routes
- Use revalidateTag for efficient cache invalidation in Next.js
- When implementing voting systems, ensure proper client ID generation and storage for anonymous users
- Use mock data for testing API endpoints during development to avoid database dependencies
- Implement comprehensive error handling in API routes with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Create maintenance scripts for fixing data inconsistencies with dry-run options
- When implementing vote toggling in a voting system, ensure the API properly handles the case when a user votes the same way twice (which should remove the vote)
- Use optimistic UI updates with proper fallback mechanisms to provide immediate feedback while ensuring data consistency
- For testing API endpoints, use direct curl commands to verify functionality before integrating with the UI
- When implementing client-side vote status tracking, maintain a local state that's updated optimistically but verified with server responses
- Store vote status in a structured format that includes both the vote type and counts to ensure consistent UI updates
- Always check for null or undefined values in API responses before accessing their properties to prevent "Cannot read properties of null" errors
- When sorting products by votes, consider multiple sorting criteria: first by score (upvotes - downvotes), then by total votes, and finally by name
- Ensure proper type handling in TypeScript by using Partial<Type> or any when dealing with data that might not have all required properties
- When implementing mock APIs, include a score property calculated as (upvotes - downvotes) to enable proper product ranking
- When toggling votes, ensure the API correctly updates vote counts by incrementing/decrementing the appropriate counter and recalculating the score
- For vote status checks, include hasVoted and voteType fields in the response to provide complete information about the user's voting status
- Implement proper error handling in the API to ensure consistent responses even when unexpected conditions occur

9. [X] Vote counts are consistently updated across all API responses
10. [X] Score is correctly recalculated after each vote action

### Final Testing Results
We performed comprehensive testing of the voting system using direct API calls:

1. **Upvoting a product**:
   - Successfully added an upvote
   - Increased upvote count from 5 to 6
   - Set vote type to 1
   - Updated score from 3 to 4

2. **Toggling an upvote**:
   - Successfully removed the upvote
   - Decreased upvote count from 6 to 5
   - Set vote type to null
   - Updated score from 4 to 3

3. **Downvoting a product**:
   - Successfully added a downvote
   - Increased downvote count from 2 to 3
   - Set vote type to -1
   - Updated score from 3 to 2

4. **Toggling a downvote**:
   - Successfully removed the downvote
   - Decreased downvote count from 3 to 2
   - Set vote type to null
   - Updated score from 2 to 3

All vote actions were properly reflected in the vote status checks, confirming that the voting system is working correctly.
