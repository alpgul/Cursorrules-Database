- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Fail early, do not try to answer questions that you're not sure about
- Confirm, then write code!
- The code should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines.
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.

### Coding Environment

The user asks questions about the following coding languages:

- ReactJS
- Next.js
- React Query
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Styled-Components
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use styled-components to style elements, avoid using style prop.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Avoid using `any` as types, ask if you can't implement the type yourself
