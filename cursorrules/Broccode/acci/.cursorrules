## RUST PROGRAMMING GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES 2025

### ALWAYS ADHERE TO CLIPPY CONFIGURATION IN .clippy.toml

### MEMORY MANAGEMENT

- Never use unsafe blocks unless absolutely necessary and thoroughly documented
- Prefer owned types over references when data ownership is clear
- Use references for read-only data sharing across functions
- Implement Drop trait for custom types that manage resources
- Avoid Rc/Arc unless shared ownership is explicitly required

### TYPE SYSTEM

- Leverage type inference but explicitly annotate public interfaces
- Use newtype pattern to enforce type-level constraints
- Implement From/Into for clean type conversions
- Prefer associated types over generic parameters for single implementations
- Use PhantomData to indicate type relationships

### ERROR HANDLING

- Return Result for operations that can fail
- Use anyhow for application code error handling
- Use thiserror for library error definitions
- Avoid unwrap/expect in production code
- Implement custom error types for library-specific errors

### ASYNC PROGRAMMING

- Use tokio for async runtime in production
- Prefer Stream over handling vectors of futures
- Implement proper cancellation handling:
  - Ensure all async operations handle cancellation gracefully
  - Test cancellation scenarios explicitly
  - Implement proper cleanup on cancellation
  - Use structured concurrency patterns
- Use async-trait for traits with async functions
- Keep async boundaries at edge of application
- Test async operations thoroughly:

  - Fast execution for immediate feedback
  - Run with `cargo test`

- Integration Tests:
  - Must be in the `/tests` directory
  - All mocks must be defined in `/tests/src/mocks`
  - Test the interaction of multiple components
  - May use external dependencies and mocks
  - Run with `cargo test --test '*'`
  - Use testcontainers-rs for container-based tests

- Test Organization:
  - Clear separation between unit and integration tests
  - No mocks allowed in the crates
  - Only use mocks in integration tests
  - Common test utilities in `/tests/src/helpers`
  - Fixtures in `/tests/src/fixtures`

### PERFORMANCE

- Use facade pattern for simplified interfaces

### CI/CD PRACTICES

- Run tests on every PR
- Perform security scanning of dependencies
- Generate and verify SBOMs
- Use cargo deny in CI pipeline
- Implement automated release processes
- ALWAYS update the CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased] and print out commit message when making changes and update the version number in package.version (root Cargo.toml) when releasing a new version.
- When Asked to Commit Staged Changes always check changelog to see if the changes in staged files are represented in the changelog before commiting.
- When releasing: Review [Unreleased] changes to determine version bump (features→minor, fixes→patch, breaking→major), move changes to new version section with date, update package.version (root Cargo.toml), commit as "release: Version X.Y.Z", and create git tag

### SECURITY

- Regular dependency updates
- Security audit in CI pipeline
- Generate CycloneDX SBOM
- Implement proper secret management
- Use constant-time comparisons for sensitive data

### DOCUMENTATION

- Document all public APIs in English only
- Include examples in documentation
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and PLAN.md in English
- Document unsafe blocks thoroughly
- Include licensing information
- All code comments MUST be in English
- All rustdoc documentation MUST be in English
- All variable names, function names, and other identifiers MUST be in English
- Documentation must be clear, concise, and follow standard rustdoc conventions
- Examples in documentation must be runnable and tested
- Repository documentation (excluding API docs) must be available in English

### PROJECT MANAGEMENT

- Reference ARCHITECTURE.md for all feature implementations
- Propagate the architecture to all code
- Ensure new code aligns with defined milestones
- Follow the established database schema
- Consider cost optimizations defined in metrics
- Maintain consistency with existing components
- Before starting a new feature, always check the architecture to see if the feature is already implemented
- When adding/changing a dependency, always ensure that feature flags really exist for the used version of the dependency

### CONTAINER BEST PRACTICES

- Use multi-stage builds
- Implement proper health checks
- Use distroless base images
- Implement proper signal handling
- Handle container lifecycle properly
- In Compose files, omit the "version" attribute

### LOGGING

- Use tracing crate for structured logging
- Implement consistent log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
- Include correlation IDs in all log entries
- Log in JSON format for production environments
- Include contextual information (request_id, user_id, service_name)
- Avoid logging sensitive information (PII, credentials)
- Implement log rotation and retention policies
- Use span events for tracking request lifecycle

### METRICS

- Implement RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration)
- Use metrics-rs for collecting application metrics
- Export metrics in Prometheus format
- Track system metrics (CPU, Memory, I/O)
- Monitor connection pool statistics
- Implement custom business metrics
- Set up alerting thresholds
- Track SLO/SLI compliance

### TRACING

- Implement OpenTelemetry integration
- Use distributed tracing across services
- Track external service calls

- Implement error categorization
- Monitor validation failures
- Track rate limiting events
- Implement error reporting (e.g., Sentry)

### DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT

- All dependencies MUST be defined in the root Cargo.toml's [workspace.dependencies] section
- Individual crate Cargo.toml files should only use workspace = true references
- When adding new dependencies:
  1. First add them to [workspace.dependencies] with version and features
  2. Then reference them in individual crates using { workspace = true }
  3. Never specify versions or features in individual crate Cargo.toml files
- Features should be configured at the workspace level only
- Version requirements should be specified only once in the workspace
- Dependencies shared across multiple crates must use workspace inheritance
- Check for existing workspace dependencies before adding new ones
- Maintain consistent versioning across the workspace
- Document breaking dependency changes in CHANGELOG.md

## ALWAYS END THE CHAT WITH A RANDOM EMOJI

<cursor-tools Integration>
# Instructions
Use the following commands to get AI assistance:

**Web Search:**
`cursor-tools web "<your question>"` - Get answers from the web using Perplexity AI (e.g., `cursor-tools web "latest weather in London"`)
when using web for complex queries suggest writing the output to a file somewhere like local-research/<query summary>.md.

**Repository Context:**
`cursor-tools repo "<your question>"` - Get context-aware answers about this repository using Google Gemini (e.g., `cursor-tools repo "explain authentication flow"`)

**Documentation Generation:**
`cursor-tools doc [options]` - Generate comprehensive documentation for this repository (e.g., `cursor-tools doc --output docs.md`)
when using doc for remote repos suggest writing the output to a file somewhere like local-docs/<repo-name>.md.

**GitHub Information:**
`cursor-tools github pr [number]` - Get the last 10 PRs, or a specific PR by number (e.g., `cursor-tools github pr 123`)
`cursor-tools github issue [number]` - Get the last 10 issues, or a specific issue by number (e.g., `cursor-tools github issue 456`)

**Browser Automation (Stateless):**
`cursor-tools browser open <url> [options]` - Open a URL and capture page content, console logs, and network activity (e.g., `cursor-tools browser open "https://example.com" --html`)
`cursor-tools browser act "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Execute actions on a webpage using natural language instructions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser act "Click Login" --url=https://example.com`)
`cursor-tools browser observe "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Observe interactive elements on a webpage and suggest possible actions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser observe "interactive elements" --url=https://example.com`)
`cursor-tools browser extract "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Extract data from a webpage based on natural language instructions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser extract "product names" --url=https://example.com/products`)

**Notes on Browser Commands:**

- All browser commands are stateless: each command starts with a fresh browser instance and closes it when done.
- When using `--connect-to`, special URL values are supported:
  - `current`: Use the existing page without reloading
  - `reload-current`: Use the existing page and refresh it (useful in development)
- Multi step workflows involving state or combining multiple actions are supported in the `act` command using the pipe (|) separator (e.g., `cursor-tools browser act "Click Login | Type 'user@example.com' into email | Click Submit" --url=https://example.com`)
- Video recording is available for all browser commands using the `--video=<directory>` option. This will save a video of the entire browser interaction at 1280x720 resolution. The video file will be saved in the specified directory with a timestamp.
- DO NOT ask browser act to "wait" for anything, the wait command is currently disabled in Stagehand.

**Tool Recommendations:**

- `cursor-tools web` is best for general web information not specific to the repository.
- `cursor-tools repo` is ideal for repository-specific questions, planning, code review and debugging.
- `cursor-tools doc` generates documentation for local or remote repositories.
- `cursor-tools browser` is useful for testing and debugging web apps.

**Running Commands:**

1. **Installed version:** Use `cursor-tools <command>` (if in PATH) or `npm exec cursor-tools "<command>"`, `yarn cursor-tools "<command>"`, `pnpm cursor-tools "<command>"`.
2. **Without installation:** Use `npx -y cursor-tools@latest "<command>"` or `bunx -y cursor-tools@latest "<command>"`.

**General Command Options (Supported by all commands):**
--model=<model name>: Specify an alternative AI model to use
--max-tokens=<number>: Control response length
--save-to=<file path>: Save command output to a file (in *addition* to displaying it)
--help: View all available options (help is not fully implemented yet)

**Documentation Command Options:**
--from-github=<GitHub username>/<repository name>[@<branch>]: Generate documentation for a remote GitHub repository

**GitHub Command Options:**
--from-github=<GitHub username>/<repository name>[@<branch>]: Access PRs/issues from a specific GitHub repository

--screenshot=<file path>: Save a screenshot of the page
--timeout=<milliseconds>: Set navigation timeout (default: 30000ms)
--viewport=<width>x<height>: Set viewport size (e.g., 1280x720). When using --connect-to, viewport is only changed if this option is explicitly provided
--headless: Run browser in headless mode (default: true)
--no-headless: Show browser UI (non-headless mode) for debugging
--connect-to=<port>: Connect to existing Chrome instance
--wait=<duration or selector>: Wait after page load (e.g., '5s', '#element-id', 'selector:.my-class')

**Additional Notes:**

- For detailed information, see `node_modules/cursor-tools/README.md` (if installed locally).
- Configuration is in `cursor-tools.config.json` (or `~/.cursor-tools/config.json`).
- API keys are loaded from `.cursor-tools.env` (or `~/.cursor-tools/.env`).
- Browser commands require separate installation of Playwright: `npm install --save-dev playwright` or `npm install -g playwright`.
- **Remember:** You're part of a team of superhuman expert AIs. Work together to solve complex problems.
