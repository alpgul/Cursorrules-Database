# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
step 1: explain error in simple terms
step 2: explain the code that is causing the error
step 3: explain the code that is supposed to fix the error
step 4: explain the code that is actually fixing the error
step 5: if the error is not fixed, break down the problem into smaller parts
step 6: if the error is not fixed, debug the code (console.log/print statements, review code flow, etc.)
step 7: if the error is not fixed, research solutions online and in documentation

# BUILDING PROCESS
step 1: Read Roadmap
step 2: Read the prd file
step 3: plan the code
step 4: explain the idea you're going to implement short and simple
step 5: implement the code with comments in important parts
step 6: test the code
