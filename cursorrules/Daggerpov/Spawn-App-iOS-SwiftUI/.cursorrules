# Cursor Rules for Spawn App iOS SwiftUI

## Code Generation Guidelines

### Figma to Code Plugin Output
When working with Figma to code plugin output or any UI design conversion:

1. **NEVER include status bar elements** such as:
   - Phone battery indicators
   - Signal strength indicators  
   - Time displays (9:41, etc.)
   - WiFi/cellular icons
   - Carrier names
   - Any system status indicators

2. **Focus on actual UI components** only:
   - App content and navigation
   - User interface elements
   - Custom buttons, images, and text
   - Layout containers and spacing

3. **Safe area handling**:
   - Use proper SafeArea modifiers for content
   - Ignore safe areas only when explicitly needed for full-screen experiences

### SwiftUI Best Practices
- Use semantic color names instead of hardcoded RGB values when possible
- Implement proper state management with @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject
- Use proper view modifiers for layout and styling
- Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines

### Project-Specific Rules
- Use custom fonts (Onest family) as defined in the project
- Follow the established color scheme and design system
- Maintain consistency with existing UI components
- Use proper image assets from the project's asset catalog
