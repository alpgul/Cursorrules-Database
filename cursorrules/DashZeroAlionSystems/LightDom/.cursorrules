- Web crawler and optimization engine
- PostgreSQL database integration

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE #1: ALWAYS SEARCH EXISTING CODE FIRST

> **This is the PRIMARY rule that overrides all others. Never skip this step.**

**MANDATORY PROCESS - BEFORE writing ANY new code:**

### Step 1: Comprehensive Code Search (REQUIRED)

```bash
# 1. Search by functionality keywords
grep -r "relevant.*keyword" services/ src/ scripts/ api/

# 2. Find files by name pattern
find . -name "*relevant*" -type f -not -path "*/node_modules/*"

# 3. Search for class/function definitions
grep -r "class.*Feature\|function.*feature" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"

# 4. Check for imports and usage
grep -r "import.*Feature" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"

# 5. Use ripgrep for faster searches (if available)
rg "search term" --type ts --type js
```

### Step 2: Review Existing Services (REQUIRED)

Search these directories in order:
1. `services/` - 100+ service files, many may solve your problem
2. `api/` - API route handlers and middleware
3. `src/services/` - TypeScript services and business logic
4. `src/components/` - React components and UI elements
5. `scripts/` - Automation scripts and utilities
6. `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
7. `src/core/` - Core business logic
8. `src/hooks/` - React hooks for state and logic

### Step 3: Check for Disconnected Code (REQUIRED)

Many features exist but aren't fully integrated. Look for:
- Unused imports
- Commented-out code that works
- Services in `services/` not referenced elsewhere
- Components not imported in any routes
- Utilities not exported in index files

### Step 4: Search Pattern Examples (REQUIRED)

**ALWAYS use these search patterns before creating new code:**

| Creating... | Must Search For... | Example Commands |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| SEO extractor | `seo`, `attribute`, `extract`, `meta`, `og:` | `grep -r "seo" services/ src/` |
| Animation mining | `animation`, `styleguide`, `mine`, `css` | `find . -name "*animation*"` |
| TensorFlow model | `tensorflow`, `model`, `train`, `ml`, `ai` | `grep -r "tensorflow" .` |
| Database ops | `db`, `query`, `pool`, `connection`, `sql` | `grep -r "pool\\.query" .` |
| API endpoint | `router`, `endpoint`, `api`, `route`, `express` | `grep -r "router\\." api/` |
| UI component | `component`, `react`, `dashboard`, `ui` | `find src/components/ -name "*Dashboard*"` |
| Blockchain | `blockchain`, `contract`, `ethereum`, `web3` | `grep -r "ethers" contracts/` |
| Auth system | `auth`, `login`, `token`, `jwt`, `session` | `grep -r "authenticate" api/` |
| Crawler | `crawl`, `scrape`, `puppeteer`, `selenium` | `grep -r "puppeteer" services/` |
| Testing | `test`, `spec`, `mock`, `fixture` | `find test/ -name "*test*"` |

### Step 5: Decision Point (REQUIRED)

**Only proceed to write new code if ALL of these are true:**
- ✅ Completed comprehensive search (Steps 1-4)
- ✅ No existing solution found
- ✅ No existing code can be adapted/extended
- ✅ Confirmed with team/docs that feature doesn't exist
- ✅ Creating truly new functionality

**If ANY existing code is found:**
- ✅ Reuse it directly, or
- ✅ Extend it with new functionality, or
- ✅ Refactor it to be more generic, or
- ✅ Connect it to the rest of the system

### Rationale

We have **substantial existing code** (~100+ services, 200+ files, 50+ components) that may not be fully connected or documented. 

**Benefits of reusing existing code:**
1. 🚀 **Faster development** - No need to write from scratch
2. 🛡️ **Battle-tested** - Existing code is proven to work
3. 🔧 **Maintainable** - Fewer places to update
4. 📚 **Consistent** - Follows established patterns
5. 🐛 **Fewer bugs** - Existing code is already debugged
6. 📊 **Better architecture** - Improves code organization

**Costs of creating new code unnecessarily:**
1. ❌ **Duplication** - Multiple implementations of same feature
2. ❌ **Technical debt** - More code to maintain
3. ❌ **Inconsistency** - Different patterns for same problem
4. ❌ **Higher bug risk** - New code needs debugging
5. ❌ **Wasted effort** - Solving already-solved problems
6. ❌ **Confusion** - Which implementation to use?

### ⚠️ Violation Consequences

**If you create new code without searching first:**
- PR will be rejected with "search-first-violation" label
- Must demonstrate comprehensive search was performed
- Must justify why existing code cannot be used
- May be asked to refactor to use existing code

## DeepSeek-OCR & Optical Compression Best Practices

### Overview
DeepSeek-OCR implements "Contexts Optical Compression" - converting text to 2D visual representations for 10-20× compression while maintaining 97%+ accuracy. This section provides rules for optimal usage in LightDom.

**Reference Documentation**: See `DEEPSEEK_OCR_INTEGRATION.md` and `DEEPSEEK_OCR_BEST_PRACTICES.md` for complete details.

### Rule 1: Compression Ratio Selection
**ALWAYS choose compression ratio based on use case:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Use case-specific compression
const legalDoc = await ocrService.processDocument(input, {
  compressionRatio: 0.15, // 6-7× for legal docs (99% precision)
});

const trainingData = await ocrService.processDocument(input, {
  compressionRatio: 0.05, // 20× for training data (60-90% precision)
});

// ❌ BAD: Generic compression for all cases
const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input, {
  compressionRatio: 0.1 // Not optimized for use case
});
```

**Compression Guidelines:**
- Legal/Medical: 0.15-0.20 (5-7×, 99%+ precision)
- Business Docs: 0.10-0.15 (7-10×, 95%+ precision)
- Archives: 0.08-0.12 (8-13×, 90%+ precision)
- Training Data: 0.05-0.08 (13-20×, 60-90% precision)

### Rule 2: Vision Token Optimization
**ALWAYS calculate target vision tokens based on LLM context window:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Calculate compression for context window
function calculateOptimalCompression(documentSize, contextWindow) {
  const estimatedTokens = Math.ceil(documentSize / 4);
  const targetTokens = Math.floor(contextWindow * 0.8); // Use 80% of context
  return Math.max(0.05, Math.min(0.2, targetTokens / estimatedTokens));
}

// ❌ BAD: Hardcoded compression without context consideration
const compression = 0.1; // May exceed context window
```

### Rule 3: Batch Processing
**ALWAYS use batch processing for multiple documents:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Batch processing with proper sizing
const results = await ocrService.processBatch(documents, {
  batchSize: 20, // Optimal for GPU (15-25)
  outputFormat: 'json'
});

ocrService.on('batch-completed', ({ batchNumber, documentsProcessed }) => {
  console.log(`Batch ${batchNumber}: ${documentsProcessed} docs processed`);
});

// ❌ BAD: Processing one by one
for (const doc of documents) {
  await ocrService.processDocument(doc); // Inefficient
}
```

**Batch Size Guidelines:**
- GPU (A100): 15-25 documents
- GPU (other): 10-15 documents
- CPU: 5-10 documents

### Rule 4: Output Format Selection
**ALWAYS choose format based on downstream processing:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: JSON for programmatic processing
const structured = await ocrService.extractStructuredData(input, {
  outputFormat: 'json',
  extractTables: true,
  extractFigures: true
});

// ✅ GOOD: Markdown for CMS
const markdown = await ocrService.processDocument(input, {
  outputFormat: 'markdown',
  preserveLayout: true
});

// ❌ BAD: Using text and losing structure
const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input, {
  outputFormat: 'text' // Loses tables, layout, figures
});
```

### Rule 5: Error Handling & Retries
**ALWAYS implement retry logic with exponential backoff:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Robust retry with backoff
async function processWithRetry(input, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await ocrService.processDocument(input);
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt < maxRetries) {
        const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt - 1) * 1000;
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      } else {
        throw error;
      }
    }
  }
}

// ❌ BAD: No retry logic
const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input); // May fail
```

### Rule 6: Performance Monitoring
**ALWAYS track and analyze performance metrics:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Comprehensive monitoring
ocrService.on('document-processed', (event) => {
  metrics.record('ocr.compression_ratio', event.compressionRatio);
  metrics.record('ocr.confidence', event.confidence);
  metrics.record('ocr.processing_time_ms', event.processingTimeMs);
  
  if (event.confidence < 0.9) {
    alerts.warn(`Low OCR confidence: ${event.confidence}`);
  }
});

// Periodic stats review
setInterval(() => {
  const stats = ocrService.getStats();
  console.log('OCR Stats:', {
    avgCompression: stats.averageCompressionRatio.toFixed(2),
    avgConfidence: stats.averageConfidence.toFixed(3)
  });
}, 60000);

// ❌ BAD: No monitoring
const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input); // No visibility
```

### Rule 7: Language Hints
**ALWAYS provide language hints when known:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Providing language hints
const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input, {
  language: documentMetadata.language || 'en',
  outputFormat: 'markdown'
});

// ✅ GOOD: Auto-detect for unknown
const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input, {
  language: undefined // Auto-detect
});
console.log('Detected:', result.metadata.language);

// ❌ BAD: Never providing hints
const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input); // Less accurate
```

### Rule 8: Large Document Handling
**ALWAYS chunk large documents to avoid timeouts:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Chunking large documents
async function processLargeDocument(url, chunkSizeMB = 10) {
  const chunks = await splitDocumentIntoChunks(url, chunkSizeMB);
  const results = await ocrService.processBatch(chunks, {
    batchSize: 10,
    compressionRatio: 0.1
  });
  return combineChunkedResults(results);
}

// ❌ BAD: Processing huge document at once
const result = await ocrService.processDocument({
  url: 'huge-100mb-document.pdf' // May timeout
});
```

### Rule 9: Result Caching
**ALWAYS cache OCR results to avoid reprocessing:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Caching results
async function processWithCache(input, options = {}) {
  const cacheKey = generateCacheKey(input, options);
  const cached = await cache.get(cacheKey);
  if (cached) return cached;
  
  const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input, options);
  await cache.set(cacheKey, result, { ttl: 86400 }); // 24 hours
  return result;
}

// ❌ BAD: Always reprocessing
const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input); // Wastes resources
```

### Rule 10: Confidence Validation
**ALWAYS validate confidence and handle low results:**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Validating confidence
async function processReliably(input, options = {}) {
  const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input, options);
  
  if (result.metadata.confidence < 0.9) {
    console.warn('Low confidence:', result.metadata.confidence);
    
    // Retry with lower compression
    if (options.compressionRatio > 0.1) {
      return processReliably(input, {
        ...options,
        compressionRatio: Math.min(options.compressionRatio * 1.5, 0.2)
      });
    }
    
    // Flag for manual review
    await flagForManualReview(result);
  }
  
  return result;
}

// ❌ BAD: Ignoring confidence
const result = await ocrService.processDocument(input);
processText(result.text); // May be inaccurate
```

### Integration Patterns

#### DOM Content Compression
```javascript
// ✅ Use optical compression for large DOM structures
async function optimizeLargeDOM(domContent) {
  const sizeKB = Buffer.from(domContent.html).length / 1024;
  if (sizeKB > 100) {
    return await ocrService.compressDOMOptically(domContent, {
      targetTokens: 200,
      preserveLayout: true
    });
  }
  return domContent.html;
}
```

#### Training Data Generation
```javascript
// ✅ Generate compressed training data
async function generateTrainingData(urls) {
  const trainingData = [];
  for (const url of urls) {
    const compressed = await ocrService.processDocument(
      { url: await crawler.screenshot(url) },
      {
        compressionRatio: 0.05, // High compression
        outputFormat: 'json',
        extractTables: true
      }
    );
    trainingData.push(compressed);
  }
  return trainingData;
}
```

#### Document Archive
```javascript
// ✅ Archive with searchable content
async function archiveDocument(document) {
  const ocr = await ocrService.processDocument(
    { url: document.url },
    {
      compressionRatio: 0.1,
      outputFormat: 'markdown',
      preserveLayout: true
    }
  );
  
  await db.documents.create({
    id: document.id,
    content: ocr.text,
    metadata: ocr.metadata,
    searchVector: createSearchVector(ocr.text)
  });
}
```

### Configuration Best Practices

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
OCR_WORKER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000
DEEPSEEK_OCR_ENDPOINT=https://api.deepseek.com/ocr
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OCR_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION_RATIO=0.1
OCR_MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_MB=25
OCR_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
```

**Service Configuration:**
```javascript
const ocrService = new DeepSeekOCRService({
  defaultCompressionRatio: 0.1,
  maxCompressionRatio: 0.05,
  targetVisionTokens: 100,
  minOcrPrecision: 0.97,
  preserveLayout: true,
  extractTables: true,
  extractFigures: true
});
```

### Testing Best Practices

```javascript
describe('DeepSeek-OCR', () => {
  it('should maintain 97%+ precision at 10× compression', async () => {
    const result = await ocrService.processDocument(testDoc, {
      compressionRatio: 0.1
    });
    expect(result.metadata.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(0.97);
    expect(result.metadata.compressionRatio).toBeGreaterThan(9);
  });
  
  it('should achieve 20× compression for training', async () => {
    const result = await ocrService.processDocument(testDoc, {
      compressionRatio: 0.05
    });
    expect(result.metadata.compressionRatio).toBeGreaterThan(15);
  });
});
```
