I need you to generate the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a professional, responsive website for a material testing and research company called "IMRC Labs" (website domain: imrclabs.com). The website should be fast-loading, smooth to navigate and scroll, and visually appealing, with a focus on using icons where appropriate. The site must be fully responsive, adapting perfectly to both desktop (laptop/PC) and mobile (phone) screen sizes.  The overall theme should be a *light theme* with cream-colored backgrounds.

The website will consist of the following pages: Homepage, About Us, Services (with a dropdown menu for sub-pages), Projects, Certificates, and Contact Us.

**General Instructions:**

*   **Languages:** Use HTML for structure, CSS for styling (including responsiveness), and JavaScript for interactive elements (like the dropdown menu, smooth scrolling, and form validation). NO frameworks like react,angular etc. For any backend functionality (specifically, the contact form email sending), assume a Python environment is available, and provide the necessary *conceptual* Python code (details below). Do not build a full Flask or Django app; just the email sending logic.
*   **Responsiveness:** Use CSS media queries to ensure the layout and elements adjust correctly for different screen sizes. Test for both large desktop screens and small mobile screens.
*   **Performance:** Optimize for speed. Assume all images are already optimized. Use efficient CSS and JavaScript. Minimize HTTP requests.
*   **Icons:** Use a free icon library like Font Awesome (v5 or v6). Include the necessary `<link>` tag in the `<head>` to load Font Awesome. Choose appropriate icons for service categories, contact information, etc.
*   **Image Placeholder:** There is an "images" folder containing a single image named "test.png". Use this "test.png" image as a placeholder *everywhere* an image is needed. I will replace these later with the correct images. Make sure the `<img>` tags have appropriate `alt` attributes describing the intended image.
*   **Favicon:** Give the website a suitable favicon.
*   **Styling:** Create a visually stunning and highly functional website that provides an exceptional user experience across all devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones) and various screen sizes.

Design Requirements:

Aesthetic:
Develop a unique and memorable visual theme that is both beautiful and engaging.
Utilize a sophisticated color palette, typography, and imagery that align with the website's purpose and target audience.
Aim for an 'extraordinary' design, incorporating modern design trends and innovative visual elements.
UI/UX:
Prioritize intuitive navigation and a seamless user flow.
Design clean, uncluttered interfaces that are easy to understand and use.
Incorporate subtle and impactful animations to enhance user engagement and provide visual feedback.
Ensure all interactive elements are responsive and perform smoothly across all devices.
Focus on accessibility, ensuring the design is usable by individuals with disabilities.
Provide detailed wireframes for all pages, showing the layout and element placement.
Give examples of button styling, form design, and image placement.
Responsiveness:
Create a fully responsive design that adapts flawlessly to different screen sizes and orientations.
Provide specific examples of how the layout and elements will adjust for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
Specify how the navigation menu will change based on screen size.
Animations: use proper animations that work with phones and laptops. 
Theme:  light mode, futuristic. 
*   **Comments:** Include clear and concise comments in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to explain the purpose of different sections and elements.
*   **Structure:** Follow best practices of HTML sematic tags.
