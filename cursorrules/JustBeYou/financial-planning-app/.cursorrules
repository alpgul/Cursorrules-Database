# Project Configuration and Development Rules

Ignore .cursorrules and README.md files.

## Environment

* Use **Node.js v22**.
* Select Node version via **nvm** (`.nvmrc` should specify `22`).
* Use **TypeScript v5**.
* Avoid modifying `.env` files unless explicitly specified.

## Framework and Libraries

* Use **Next.js v15**.
* Use **React v19**.
* Use **Tailwind CSS v4**.
* Use **Drizzle** and **drizzle-orm** for database access.
* Use **SQLite** as the database engine.
* Use **tRPC v11** for type-safe API communication.
* Use **Zod v3** for runtime validation.
* For forms, try to reuse existing components and not bring additional libraries.

## Tooling

* Use **Biome** for linting and formatting.
* Use the command from `package.json` when necessary. Check for commands existing there before
 adding new packages or using npx.
* You need to use `set -a && source .env && npm run db:sed` when seeding the local db.

## Code Organization

* Keep all code **modular and DRY**. Avoid duplication across components, utilities, and business logic.
* Group related functionality by domain. Follow feature-first or domain-driven folder structure.
* Use absolute imports to simplify navigation and refactoring.
* The absolute import alias is `~/`.
* Before adding a new feature/component/API routes etc. check if you may need to reuse existing code to avoid duplication.
* Try to keep UI components split in two categories: smart (with business logic, API fetching etc.) and dumb (only UI, data taken from props).
* Try to keep files under 500 lines of code. Split code into reasonable modules/components when necessary.
* `src/app` should be for publicly exposed stuff (frontend).
* `src/app/components` should be for re-usable components.
* `src/server` should be for the backend.
* `src/lib` should be for generic business logic that may be shared across the entire project (frontend and backend).

## Testing

* Write **unit and integration tests** for every functionality.
* Cover both **frontend and backend** logic.
* Use **Vitest** and **testing-library** for unit testing.
* Use **Playwright** for end-to-end (E2E) testing.
* Maintain high code coverage, but prioritize meaningful test scenarios.

## Documentation

* Use **docblocks** (`/** */`) to document functions, types, and modules.
* Avoid unnecessary inline comments.
* Consult specifications in `specs/` when implementing or modifying features.

## Git Commit Guidelines

* **Subject Line**: Keep it under 50 characters, use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
* **Format**: `type(scope): short description`
* **Types**: 
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code refactoring without feature changes
  - `test`: Adding or updating tests
  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks, build process, etc.
* **Body**: Use for detailed explanation when needed. Separate from subject with blank line.
* **Footer**: Reference issues/PRs when applicable.
* **Example**:
  ```
  feat: add user authentication with NextAuth
  
  - Implement CredentialsProvider for login
  - Create login form component with validation
  - Add session management with JWT strategy
  - Remove previous OAuth setup
  
  Closes #123
  ```
* Use a temporary file for the commit message so you can use multiple lines.

## Additional Suggestions

* Prefer server components in Next.js where performance is improved.
* Use environment variables for sensitive or environment-specific values.
* Validate inputs at the API layer using **Zod** schemas shared with the client.
* Auto-generate API and database types where applicable.
* Keep a changelog or follow conventional commits for traceability.

## Enforcement

These rules are to be followed by all team members and enforced via tooling and peer review to ensure consistency and maintainability.
