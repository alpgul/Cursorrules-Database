# Cursor Rules

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST ‚ö†Ô∏è
STOP! Before writing ANY code or suggesting ANY changes:

1. üîç SEARCH FIRST:
   ```bash
   # REQUIRED: Run these searches and document results
   grep_search for functionality
   file_search for similar files
   list_dir in relevant directories
   ```

2. üìù DOCUMENT FINDINGS:
   ```markdown
   # REQUIRED: Fill this out
   ## Existing Files Found:
   - [List all relevant files found with full paths]
   - [Include file sizes and last modified dates if relevant]
   
   ## Existing Functionality:
   - [Describe what already exists in detail]
   - [Note any patterns or architectural approaches used]
   
   ## Gaps Identified:
   - [List what's missing or needs enhancement]
   - [Identify technical debt or issues in existing code]
   
   ## Implementation Decision Tree:
   - Is there existing code that serves this purpose? [Yes/No]
   - Can existing code be enhanced to meet requirements? [Yes/No]
   - Is creating new code justified? [Yes/No, with reasoning]
   
   ## Proposed Approach:
   - [ ] Enhance existing code at [file path]
   - [ ] Create new files (requires detailed justification)
   - [ ] Refactor existing code at [file path]
   
   ## Implementation Plan:
   1. [First step with estimated effort]
   2. [Second step with estimated effort]
   3. [Additional steps as needed]
   ```

3. ‚úã WAIT FOR APPROVAL:
   - Present findings to user with clear options
   - Get explicit approval for chosen approach
   - Never proceed with new files if similar functionality exists
   - Document approval in the implementation plan

‚ùå IF YOU SKIP THIS CHECKLIST, YOU ARE VIOLATING THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE ‚ùå
