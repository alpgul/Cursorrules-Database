# Cursor Rules for js-stadium Project

## Code Style Preferences
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
- Maximum line length of 79 characters
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Add docstrings to all modules, classes, functions, and methods
- Use type annotations for all function parameters and return values
- Place each import on a separate line
- Group imports in the following order: standard library, related third party, local application imports
- End files with a single newline character

## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for variable and function names
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Use UPPERCASE for constants
- Use leading underscore for private functions (though the main algorithm has been renamed to "knapsack")

## Documentation Standards
- Module docstrings should describe the purpose of the module
- Class docstrings should describe the purpose of the class and list important attributes
- Function docstrings should follow the format:
  - Brief description
  - Args section for parameters
  - Returns section for return values
- Include specific types in docstrings when type annotations are not enough
- Add comments for complex logic or algorithms

## Project-Specific Patterns
- The knapsack algorithm optimizes for maximum weight within a budget
- JSON is used for storing item data
- Performance measurement is tracked using the time module
- The main function loads data and runs multiple test cases
- Sorting items by efficiency improves algorithm performance
- A maximum of 10 items is enforced for any inventory

## Repository Structure
- Python implementation files at the root level
- JSON data files at the root level
- Memory bank for documentation in the memory-bank directory
- No test directory yet (to be added)

## Development Workflow
- Fix linting issues before adding new features
- Document code thoroughly with docstrings
- Update memory bank when making significant changes
- Test algorithm with multiple budget scenarios
- Track performance metrics for optimization

## Known Challenges
- The knapsack algorithm has exponential time complexity
- The project name (js-stadium) suggests JavaScript, but the implementation is in Python
- The algorithm currently only supports single-objective optimization
- JSON data processing may have performance implications with large datasets
