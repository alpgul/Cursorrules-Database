# Project Rules

## Prompt logic and structure
- Don't use npm run dev

### UI Design
- *** Design UI for a mobile first app**
- This project uses shadcn as it's primary UI.

### ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility (e.g., components, utilities, hooks).
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Reliability
- **Always create unit tests for new features** (functions, components, utilities, hooks, etc.). Consider using a testing framework like Jest or React Testing Library.
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

### ðŸ“Ž Style & Conventions
- **Use JavaScript** as the primary language.
- **Follow a consistent style guide** (e.g., Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide) and consider using a linter like ESLint and a formatter like Prettier.
- **Utilize React best practices** for component design and state management (if applicable).
