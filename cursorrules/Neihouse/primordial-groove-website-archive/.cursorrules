Certainly! Here's the updated YAML file, aligned with your new goals of minimizing JavaScript usage and incorporating **AlpineJS** or **HTMX** if interactivity is needed.

```yaml
# Cursor Guidelines for Building the Multi-Page Website

project:
  name: "Primordial Groove Website"
  description: "A multi-page website for the Primordial Groove community, built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, minimal JavaScript, and hosted on GitHub Pages."

# Guidelines for Structure and Organization

structure:

- Ensure that each page (Home, About, Events, Contact, etc.) has its own HTML file.
- Use relative paths for internal links between pages.
- Keep a clear, hierarchical folder structure. Example:
  - /index.html
  - /about.html
  - /events.html
  - /contact.html
  - /assets/css (for any custom stylesheets)
  - /assets/images (for images from past events)
- Limit the use of unnecessary directories and files to maintain simplicity.
- **Mobile-first principle**: Prioritize structuring pages to render well on mobile screens first, and then adjust for larger devices using responsive utilities.

# Naming Conventions

naming_conventions:

- Use kebab-case for all filenames (e.g., index.html, about.html, events.html, contact.html).
- Ensure HTML element class names in Tailwind CSS follow descriptive patterns (e.g., `bg-gray-800`, `text-center`).
- Keep naming clear and meaningful for IDs or custom classes, e.g., use `main-hero` instead of `div1`.
- Tailwind class prefixes like `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` should only be used when enhancing the layout for larger screens (mobile-first).

# Styling Guidelines (Tailwind CSS)

styling:

- Utilize Tailwind CSS for all page styling. Avoid inline styles or additional CSS unless necessary.
- Stick to utility-first classes from Tailwind for rapid development and maintainability.
- **Mobile-first responsiveness**: Use base Tailwind classes for mobile devices and apply responsive breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.) to modify styles on larger screens.
- Prioritize `flex`, `grid`, and other responsive utility classes to ensure flexible layouts that adapt from mobile to desktop smoothly.
- Use Tailwind's predefined color palette or customize via config if needed to reflect the Primordial Groove ethos.
- Minimize custom CSS usage. If required, custom styles should go in `/assets/css/styles.css`.

# JavaScript Usage Guidelines

javascript:

- Aim to minimize JavaScript usage throughout the website.
- If interactivity or dynamic behavior is needed, prefer using **AlpineJS** or **HTMX**.
- Include AlpineJS or HTMX via CDN to avoid increasing build complexity.
- Avoid heavy JavaScript frameworks or libraries.
- Place any custom JavaScript at the bottom of the `<body>` tag or in separate JS files if needed.
- Ensure that the site functions correctly even if JavaScript is disabled (progressive enhancement).

# Accessibility and Semantics

accessibility:

- All images must include `alt` attributes for accessibility purposes.
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible (e.g., `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<article>`).
- Ensure all text content is readable on any background by using sufficient color contrast (e.g., `bg-gray-800 text-white`).
- **Mobile-first considerations**: Ensure that tap targets (buttons, links) are large enough for mobile users (44x44 pixels minimum) and that content is accessible without zooming or horizontal scrolling.
- Use ARIA attributes where necessary to enhance accessibility.

# Best Practices for HTML

html_practices:

- Keep HTML files clean and well-indented for readability.
- **Avoid inline JavaScript and event handlers** (e.g., `onclick`). Use data attributes with AlpineJS or HTMX for interactivity.
- **Mobile-first meta tag**: Ensure each HTML file includes a meta tag for responsive design:

  ```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  ```

- Use proper `<title>` and `<meta>` descriptions for each page.
- Keep the HTML5 `doctype` declaration at the top of every file:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  ```

- Ensure the design adapts naturally to mobile devices first, then apply enhancements for larger screens.

# Version Control Guidelines

version_control:

- Commit changes frequently with meaningful commit messages.
- Each commit should represent a logical and cohesive set of changes (e.g., "Added about page content").
- Keep the main branch clean; create feature branches for significant changes.
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files like temporary backups or `node_modules` (if used in the future).

# Content and Branding

content:

- Ensure consistency in tone and messaging across all pages.
- Use a unified design style (e.g., consistent colors, typography, and layout) that reflects the Primordial Groove ethos.
- Integrate the tagline **"Find Your Tribe, Find Your Rhythm"** prominently on the homepage.
- Use images from past events to showcase the community and authenticity.
- Avoid filler textâ€”every section must have meaningful and relevant content.
- **Mobile-first content flow**: Ensure text, images, and other media scale correctly on mobile devices. Start by testing on smaller screens and progressively enhance for larger devices.

# Deployment Guidelines

deployment:

- Ensure all necessary files (HTML, CSS, images) are committed to GitHub before deployment.
- Test all internal and external links before deploying.
- After deployment to GitHub Pages, test responsiveness and functionality on various devices and browsers.
- If you make changes, ensure they are reflected on GitHub Pages by pushing new commits.
- **Mobile-first testing**: Prioritize testing on mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) and ensure smooth navigation and usability before expanding to desktop devices.

# Performance Optimization

performance:

- Minimize the number of HTTP requests (e.g., by combining assets where possible).
- Optimize all images to reduce load times (use web-optimized formats like `.webp` where applicable).
- Leverage Tailwind CSS's purging capability to remove unused CSS classes if necessary.
- **Mobile-first optimizations**: Focus on reducing page load times and minimizing asset sizes for mobile users. Optimize for mobile network performance by compressing images and limiting heavy resources.
- Include AlpineJS or HTMX via CDN to avoid increasing the bundle size.

# Future-Proofing and Scalability

scalability:

- Keep the website modular to allow easy expansion (adding more pages or sections).
- Maintain a consistent structure so others can easily contribute to the project if needed.
- Plan for potential enhancements like adding more interactivity using AlpineJS or HTMX while keeping JavaScript minimal.
- **Mobile-first mindset**: Ensure the project can scale for future mobile-focused features, such as progressive web app (PWA) support, offline access, or further mobile optimizations.

```

This updated YAML file aligns with your new goals of minimizing JavaScript usage and preferring **AlpineJS** or **HTMX** for any required interactivity. It emphasizes building a website that reflects the ethos of **Primordial Groove** while maintaining simplicity and performance, especially on mobile devices.
