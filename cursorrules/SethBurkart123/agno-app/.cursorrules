**Write code that makes you excited!** This codebase values clarity, composability, and that satisfying feeling when everything just *clicks*.

### The Tinygrad Way
Take inspiration from tinygrad - keep it minimal, functional, and beautiful:
- **Small, focused functions** that do ONE thing really well
- **No over-abstraction** - if you can't explain it in one sentence, it's too complex
- **Composable building blocks** - functions that snap together like LEGO
- **Context managers over boilerplate** - use `with db.db_session(app):` instead of try/finally everywhere

### Make Boring Code Fun
- **Extract helpers** when you see the same pattern twice
- **Use context managers** to eliminate repetitive cleanup code
- **Break giant functions** into readable chunks - aim for <30 lines per function
- **Choose clear names** - `ensure_chat_initialized()` beats `init_chat_stuff()`
- **Clean flows** - the main function should read like a story, details go in helpers

### Extra Notes
- You do not need to generate the api client as it gets auto generated with the dev server running in the background.

### The Golden Rule
**If it feels messy, it probably is!** Refactor with joy. Future you will high-five present you.

Remember: Code is read WAY more than it's written, so make it a pleasure to read! 🚀
