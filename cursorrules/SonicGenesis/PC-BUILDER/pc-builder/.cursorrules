Web Crawler for PC Component Prices

1. Overview

This project is a web crawler designed to fetch and compare prices of PC components from multiple e-commerce websites.

2. Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

Scrapy (for large-scale scraping)

BeautifulSoup (for parsing HTML)

Selenium / Playwright (for handling dynamic pages)

Requests (for HTTP requests)

SQLite / PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for data storage)

fake_useragent & proxy rotation (for anti-scraping measures)

3. Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.8+). Install the required libraries using:

pip install scrapy beautifulsoup4 selenium playwright requests fake_useragent psycopg2 pymongo

Database Setup

SQLite (for local testing):

pip install sqlite

PostgreSQL (for production):

sudo apt install postgresql
pip install psycopg2

MongoDB (for NoSQL storage):

sudo apt install mongodb
pip install pymongo

Selenium & Playwright Setup

If using Selenium, install the WebDriver for your browser:

pip install selenium

For Playwright (preferred for better performance):

pip install playwright
playwright install

4. Running the Web Crawler

For static pages (Scrapy or BeautifulSoup-based scraper):

python static_scraper.py

For dynamic pages (Selenium or Playwright-based scraper):

python dynamic_scraper.py

5. Anti-Scraping Measures

Use fake_useragent to rotate User-Agents.

Implement proxy rotation if necessary.

Introduce delays/random intervals between requests.

6. Automating the Crawler

Use cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to schedule crawls.
Example (run every 6 hours):

crontab -e
0 */6 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/script.py

7. Storing & Managing Data

Store data in SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

Use an API (Flask / FastAPI) for structured data retrieval.

8. Future Improvements

Add more sites for wider coverage.

Implement machine learning for price trend analysis.

Optimize scraping speed & efficiency.
