Project Structure and Organization

Use a modular component architecture: Organize components by feature and responsibility using a clear hierarchy (components/, layouts/, pages/, hooks/, utils/). Keep related files close together and follow the single responsibility principle.

Implement proper separation of concerns: Keep UI components, business logic, API calls, and utilities in separate, well-defined modules for maintainability and testability.

Component Design and Reusability

Design components to be composable and reusable: Create small, focused components that can be combined to build complex UIs. Use composition over inheritance patterns.

Implement consistent component interfaces: Use TypeScript interfaces for props, maintain consistent naming conventions, and provide clear component APIs with proper documentation.

Type Safety and Validation

Leverage TypeScript strictly: Use proper type definitions for all props, state, API responses, and function parameters. Avoid 'any' types and use union types, generics, and utility types effectively.

Implement runtime validation: Use libraries like Zod or Yup for form validation and API response validation to ensure type safety at runtime, not just compile time.

State Management and Data Flow

Use appropriate state management patterns: Leverage React's built-in state management (useState, useContext) for simple cases, and consider state management libraries (Zustand, Redux Toolkit) for complex global state.

Implement predictable data flow: Ensure data flows unidirectionally, use proper lifting state up patterns, and avoid direct prop drilling through multiple component layers.

Error Handling and User Experience

Implement comprehensive error boundaries: Use React error boundaries to catch and handle component errors gracefully, providing fallback UIs and error reporting.

Provide meaningful user feedback: Display loading states, error messages, and success confirmations. Use proper accessibility attributes and ensure error messages are actionable and user-friendly.

Performance and Optimization

Optimize rendering performance: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Implement code splitting with lazy loading for route-based components.

Manage bundle size effectively: Import only necessary parts of libraries, use tree-shaking, and monitor bundle size. Implement proper caching strategies for API calls and static assets.

Accessibility and Standards

Follow WCAG guidelines: Ensure proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast. Use ARIA attributes when necessary.

Implement responsive design: Use mobile-first approaches, proper breakpoints, and flexible layouts that work across all device sizes and orientations.
