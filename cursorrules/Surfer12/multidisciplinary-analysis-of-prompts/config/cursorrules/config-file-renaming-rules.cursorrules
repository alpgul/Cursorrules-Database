# Cursor Rules for File Renaming Strategy

## Overview
This ruleset defines the approach to renaming files in the ClaudeMetaResearch project,
focusing on enhancing cognitive understanding and traceability of research documentation.

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, meaningful names that reflect document content
- Prioritize cognitive processes and meta-reflection in naming
- Maintain a consistent naming pattern across files
- Include version information when applicable
- Use hyphen-separated lowercase words

## File Naming Principles
1. Cognitive Process Emphasis
   - Highlight meta-cognitive aspects
   - Capture iterative and adaptive design approaches
   - Reflect conceptual emergence and flexibility

2. Structural Clarity
   - Provide clear indication of document purpose
   - Use prefixes that describe the primary focus

3. Version and Iteration Tracking
   - Include version numbers (e.g., `-v1`, `-v2`)
   - Use suffixes to indicate document type or focus

## Recommended Prefixes
- `prompt-engineering-`: Prompt design and refinement documents
- `meta-cognitive-`: Meta-analysis and reflective documents
- `cognitive-monitoring-`: Documents related to cognitive process monitoring
- `yaml-`: Documents focusing on YAML structure or representation
- `framework-`: Documents describing conceptual or technical frameworks

## Rationale
The renaming strategy aims to:
- Improve document discoverability
- Enhance understanding of document content at a glance
- Facilitate knowledge management
- Support recursive and meta-cognitive research approaches

## Future Improvements
- Regularly review and refine naming conventions
- Develop a comprehensive taxonomy for document naming
- Create guidelines for naming across different research domains
