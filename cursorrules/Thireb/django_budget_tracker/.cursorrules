# Code Review and Development Rules

## Priority Order for Problem Solving

### 1. Understanding Existing Code (MUST DO FIRST)
1. Current File Analysis
   - Read entire file carefully
   - Note existing functionality
   - Identify current patterns
   - Map local dependencies

2. Inheritance Chain Analysis
   - Map complete parent → child chain
   - Review all parent class implementations
   - Check abstract/interface requirements
   - Understand override patterns
   - Note protected/private methods

3. Related Code Review
   - Check sibling class implementations
   - Review similar features elsewhere
   - Map feature patterns across versions
   - Identify utility functions/helpers
   - Note common implementation approaches

### 2. Solution Approach (IN THIS ORDER)
1. Leverage Existing Code
   - Extend parent class methods
   - Reuse existing utilities
   - Adapt sibling class solutions
   - Follow established patterns

2. Modify Current Code
   - Minimal necessary changes
   - Preserve functionality
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Consider inheritance impact

3. New Implementation (ONLY IF ABOVE NOT POSSIBLE)
   - Match codebase patterns
   - Follow inheritance rules
   - Consider future extensibility
   - Document thoroughly

4. Pattern Detection Workflow
   - Identify at least 2-3 similar implementations before creating new code
   - Create a pattern map showing how similar features are implemented
   - Document any variations in pattern implementation and their reasons
   - Ensure new implementations follow the majority pattern unless there's a compelling reason not to
   - Verify URL routing consistency with similar feature implementations

## 1. Code Analysis Guidelines
### Before making changes:
- Read the entire file carefully
- Note existing functionality
- Look for recent changes
- Identify related code patterns
- Analyze dependencies between components
- Review existing documentation
- Analyze class inheritance hierarchy
- Check parent class implementations
- Review all related files (imports, parent classes, mixins)
- Look for similar implementations in sibling classes
- Identify existing utilities or helpers that could be leveraged
- Map out the full dependency tree of affected components

### Method Signature and Return Value Consistency
- Check similar models/classes for method signature patterns
- Ensure return value formats match across related classes (e.g., dictionaries vs lists)
- Standardize parameter naming across similar methods (e.g., `pk` vs `home_id`)
- Maintain consistent URL/path patterns within the same module
- Document any intentional deviations from established patterns

### Import and Dependency Management
- Before removing imports, verify they're not used by other components in the file
- When removing code elements, check for dependencies in other files
- Analyze import patterns to identify standard project conventions
- Map shared resource usage before modifying globally imported elements
- Document import dependencies when adding new components

### When suggesting changes:
- Preserve existing functionality
- Add rather than delete code
- Document why changes are needed
- Specify exact locations for changes
- Look at linked code that should also get updated
- Look at related code to find existing code that can work
+ Before suggesting new code:
    1. Check if similar functionality exists elsewhere
    2. Review parent class methods that could be extended
    3. Look for existing patterns that solve similar problems
    4. Identify reusable components or utilities
    5. Map all inheritance-based restrictions or requirements
+ Request additional context if:
    1. Parent class implementation is not visible
    2. Related files are not provided
    3. Inheritance hierarchy is unclear
    4. Dependencies are not fully mapped
+ Leverage existing code:
    1. Prefer extending existing methods over creating new ones
    2. Use established patterns found in the codebase
    3. Maintain consistency with similar implementations
    4. Consider impact on child classes

## 2. Implementation Standards

### Python Standards

# Django Project Development Guidelines

## General Django Coding Strategy

1. Always study existing implementations before creating new code.
   - Review similar files in the same module to understand patterns
   - Use established naming conventions and code organization
   - Read entire files, not just fragments when analyzing code
   - Identify existing feature flags and patterns before implementing new ones

2. Understand model relationships before writing tests or new features.
   - Check for ForeignKey, ManyToMany, and other relationships
   - Verify field types and constraints (CharField vs IntegerField, etc.)
   - Pay attention to special fields like QuestionOption references
   - Follow Django convention: use blank=True (not null=True) for CharField

3. Follow existing patterns for data access.
   - Use consistent query methods (e.g., for QuestionOption retrievals)
   - Maintain API field name to model field name mappings
   - Use existing feature flags rather than creating new ones
   - Preserve existing structural layout patterns

4. Keep implementations simple and focused.
   - Test one aspect of functionality at a time
   - Only mock/create what is necessary for the test
   - Avoid overcomplicated implementations when simpler solutions exist
   - Provide exact commands for migrations and other operations

## Testing Strategy

1. When implementing a new test:
   - Start by examining similar test files in the same module
   - Follow the established test structure and assertions
   - Use the same authentication and permission patterns

2. When a test fails:
   - Check existing working tests for the correct approach
   - Verify model relationships and field types
   - Add debugging assertions to pinpoint the issue

3. Use proper URL construction:
   - Follow project-specific URL namespacing
   - Use the correct version identifiers
   - Use helper methods like reverse_url_for_test consistently

4. Follow project-specific field access patterns:
   - Use the right serializer field names in API tests
   - Map correctly between API names and model field names
   - Handle special fields (like QuestionOption foreign keys) correctly

## Implementation Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Field Definition Errors:
   - Don't use null=True for CharField or TextField (use blank=True only)
   - Don't invent new field types that differ from established patterns
   - Don't change field parameters without understanding their purpose

2. Feature Flag Mistakes:
   - Don't create new feature flags when existing ones can be used
   - Always check for existing feature flags in imports and conditionals
   - Follow the pattern for how feature flags control behavior

3. Layout and Structure Issues:
   - Don't modify existing layouts without preserving their structure
   - Maintain all existing fields in skip logic even when adding new ones
   - Keep additions consistent with existing UI patterns

4. Documentation and Migration Guidance:
   - Always provide exact commands for migrations (not placeholders)
   - Specify all files that need to be changed
   - Document any potential side effects of changes
