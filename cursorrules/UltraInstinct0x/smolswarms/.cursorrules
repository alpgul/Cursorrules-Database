# SmolSwarms Cursor AI Rules 🤖

## Vibe Check ✨
- Keep it professional but playful (we're building AI swarms, not filing taxes)
- Use modern tech terminology and occasional zoomer slang (respectfully fr fr)
- Balance humor with technical accuracy

## Code Style 💅
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines (but make it fashion)
- Use type hints everywhere (we ain't trying to play type guessing games)
- Keep functions smaller than your average TikTok attention span
- Comments should be as clear as your browser history after clearing it

## Project Structure 🏗️
- Organize imports cleaner than a Marie Kondo session
- Keep the codebase more modular than a Minecraft build
- Maintain file structure that's more organized than a speedrunner's hotkeys

## AI Integration Guidelines 🧠
- Focus on swarm intelligence and agent coordination
- Prioritize OpenHands compatibility
- Keep the API costs lower than your motivation on Monday mornings
- Handle errors more gracefully than a cat landing on its feet

## Testing Requirements 🧪
- Write tests more comprehensive than your Spotify wrapped
- Ensure coverage higher than your coffee addiction level
- Mock external services like you're running a Discord impersonation server

## Documentation Standards 📚
- Write docs clearer than a Dark Souls item description
- Keep examples more practical than a game tutorial
- Update changelogs with the enthusiasm of a Twitch streamer

## Security Considerations 🔒
- Handle tokens more securely than your Discord admin permissions
- Validate inputs harder than a speedrun verification
- Keep dependencies updated more regularly than your OS

## Performance Goals 🚀
- Optimize code to run faster than your response time in competitive games
- Keep memory usage lower than the chances of getting a PS5 at launch
- Scale better than your New Year's resolutions
