# Lucifer - Forex Provider Service - Cursor Rules

> **Note**: This file contains Lucifer-specific rules. For common standards shared across all Shivalik stack services, see `../.cursorrules-common`

## Project Context
Lucifer is a Golang microservice that provides forex rates functionality. It handles forex rate retrieval based on user ID and country information provided via request headers (`x-user-id` and `x-country`).

## Key Differences from Other Services

- **No User Authentication**: This service uses `x-user-id` and `x-country` headers directly instead of requiring user authentication
- **Simple Service**: Focused on forex rates retrieval, minimal dependencies

## Service-Specific Patterns

### Header Extraction
- Always use `x-user-id` header for user identification (not `x-customer-id`)
- Always use `x-country` header for country information
- Use utility functions in `internal/handler/utils/header_utils.go` for header extraction

### Forex Rates Service
- The `ForexService.GetRates()` method should be implemented based on the app-server's `/v2/forex-provider/get-rates` implementation
- Currently contains placeholder logic that needs to be replaced with actual implementation

## API Endpoints

- `GET /lucifer/v2/forex-provider/get-rates` - Get forex rates for user and country
