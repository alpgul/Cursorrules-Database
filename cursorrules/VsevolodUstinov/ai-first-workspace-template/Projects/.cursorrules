# Projects Repository - Template Framework

## 📊 Project Portfolio Structure [TEMPLATE EXAMPLE]

### 🏷️ Repository Purpose
The **Projects** repository contains:
- **project_statuses/** - status tracking for all client projects ([X] projects)
- Individual client project sub-repositories
- Central hub for project portfolio management

### 👥 Team Structure ([X] people + [Y] unassigned projects) [TEMPLATE EXAMPLE]

#### Active Analysts and Their Projects:
1. **👩‍💼 [Analyst Name A]** ([X] projects) - [Specialization A], [Specialization B], [Specialization C]
   - [Example Project 1], [Example Project 2], [Example Project 3]
   
2. **👨‍💼 [Analyst Name B]** ([X] active + [Y] inactive)
   - Active: [Project List]
   - Inactive: [Project List]
   
3. **👨‍💼 [Analyst Name C]** ([X] active + [Y] inactive) 
   - Active: [Project List]
   - Inactive: [Project List]

#### ❓ Unassigned Projects ([X] projects):
- [Example Unassigned Projects List]

### 📁 Project File Structure [TEMPLATE EXAMPLE]

#### Each project should contain:
```
project_name.md
├── 🏷️ Information Sources
├── 📊 General Information
│   ├── Analyst
│   ├── Project Manager  
│   ├── Status
│   └── Last Update
├── 🎯 Current Tasks
│   ├── ✅ Completed Work
│   ├── 🔄 In Progress
│   └── ⚠️ Blockers
├── 🔧 Technical Features
├── 📈 Development Plans
└── 💡 Notes
```

### 🎯 Project Management Rules [TEMPLATE EXAMPLE]

#### When working with projects:
1. **Always assign analyst** - each project must have designated analyst
2. **Update statuses** - regularly update progress information
3. **Document blockers** - clearly document obstacles
4. **Reference sources** - link to meetings and documents

#### Maximum workload:
- **[X] active projects** per analyst (recommendation)
- **Current overloads**: [Analyst Name] ([X]), [Analyst Name] ([X] total)
- **Underutilized**: [Analyst Name] ([X] project)

### 📈 Industry Specialization [TEMPLATE EXAMPLE]

#### By industries ([X] active projects):
- **📈 [Industry Category]**: [X] projects ([Y]%)
- **🏠 [Industry Category]**: [X] projects ([Y]%)
- **🧴 [Industry Category]**: [X] projects ([Y]%)
- **💊 [Industry Category]**: [X] projects ([Y]%)
- **🎰 [Industry Category]**: [X] projects ([Y]%)
- **📅 [Industry Category]**: [X] projects ([Y]%)
- **🚗 [Industry Category]**: [X] projects ([Y]%)
- **🍽️ [Industry Category]**: [X] project ([Y]%)
- **🔧 [Industry Category]**: [X] project ([Y]%)

### ⚖️ Load Balancing [TEMPLATE EXAMPLE]

#### Critical areas:
- **Overloaded**: [Analyst Name] ([X]), [Analyst Name] ([X] total)
- **Underutilized**: [Analyst Name] ([X])
- **Unassigned**: [X] projects without analyst

#### Redistribution recommendations:
1. Assign [X-Y] projects from TBD list to [Underutilized Analyst]
2. Consider transferring [X-Y] projects from [Overloaded Analyst] to other analysts
3. [Specific Analyst]: decide on inactive projects

### 🔄 Update Processes [TEMPLATE EXAMPLE]

#### README.md updates:
- **Structure**: Grouping by analysts (not by industries)
- **Statistics**: Automatic workload calculation
- **Recommendations**: Current optimization suggestions

#### Project statuses:
- **✅ Active** - project in active development
- **⏸️ Paused** - temporarily inactive
- **🚀 Launching** - preparation for active phase

### 💡 AI Context Guidelines [TEMPLATE EXAMPLE]

When working with projects remember:
- **Always check analyst workload** before assigning new projects
- **Consider specialization** when recommending assignments
- **Monitor portfolio balance** - avoid industry concentration
- **Update statistics** after assignment changes
- **Suggest concrete actions** for balancing problems

### 📊 Key metrics for tracking:
- Number of active projects per analyst
- Percentage of unassigned projects
- Industry distribution
- Active/inactive project ratio
- Analyst specialization vs assigned projects

### 🎯 Template Project Examples:

#### [Project 1](./project_statuses/project-1.md) - Active Project
Demonstrates stable project with regular progress, clear technical features, and systematic task tracking.

#### [Project 2](./project_statuses/project-2.md) - Technical Challenges
Shows project with platform limitations, budget constraints, and effective blocker documentation.

#### [Project 3](./project_statuses/project-3.md) - Blocked Project
Illustrates project requiring escalation, external coordination, and management intervention strategies.
