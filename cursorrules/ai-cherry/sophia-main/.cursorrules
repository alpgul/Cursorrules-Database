# 🏹 ARTEMIS AI CODING SUPREMACY - CURSOR INTEGRATION
# The No-Bullshit Guide to Enterprise AI Development

## 🎯 CORE PHILOSOPHY
- **Ship or get shipped** - No participation trophies, no excuses
- **Zero tolerance** for broken code, security vulnerabilities, or performance issues
- **Dark humor** helps maintain sanity during disaster scenarios
- **Proactive problem-solving** beats reactive firefighting every time

## 🤖 ARTEMIS AGENT COORDINATION
Use Artemis orchestrator for complex multi-step development tasks:

### Agent Specialization:
- **Data Reaper**: Information extraction, research, code analysis
- **Code Enforcer**: Implementation, refactoring, enterprise standards
- **Deployment Destroyer**: Infrastructure, deployments, chaos engineering  
- **Quality Executioner**: Testing, QA, performance analysis, bug hunting
- **Chaos Coordinator**: Strategic oversight, crisis management, workflow orchestration

### Orchestration Commands:
```python
# In Cursor chat, use these patterns:
# "Artemis orchestrate: Deploy authentication refactor with zero downtime"
# "Artemis solve: Database performance is terrible after migration"
# "Artemis suggest: API responses are slow and users are complaining"
# "Artemis hardcore review: Check this code for enterprise readiness"
```

## 🛠️ ENTERPRISE CODING STANDARDS

### Code Quality Requirements:
- **Enterprise-grade only** - No shortcuts, hacks, or "it works on my machine"
- **Comprehensive error handling** - Assume everything will break spectacularly
- **Security-first mindset** - Assume everything is trying to kill your system
- **Performance optimization** - Scale from day one, not as an afterthought
- **Comprehensive logging** - You can't debug what you can't see

### Architecture Principles:
- **Clean Architecture** - Dependency inversion, separation of concerns
- **SOLID principles** - Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.
- **Domain-driven design** - Business logic drives technical decisions
- **Microservices ready** - Loosely coupled, highly cohesive components
- **Cloud-native patterns** - 12-factor app, stateless, containerizable

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT & INFRASTRUCTURE

### Deployment Standards:
- **Blue-green deployments** - Zero downtime is non-negotiable
- **Comprehensive testing** - Unit, integration, end-to-end, chaos testing
- **Rollback plans** - Every deployment needs an escape route
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Pulumi/Terraform for everything
- **Monitoring & Alerting** - If it moves, monitor it

### Technology Stack:
- **Backend**: FastAPI 3.0, Python 3.12+, async/await patterns
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis for caching
- **Vector Store**: Qdrant for semantic search and retrieval
- **Infrastructure**: Lambda Labs GPU instances, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, automated testing and deployment

## 🧠 MEMORY & CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Multi-Tier Memory Architecture:
- **SuperMemory/Mem0** - Persistent context across sessions
- **Qdrant** - Semantic search and vector similarity
- **Redis** - Fast caching and session data
- **PostgreSQL** - Structured data and relationships
- **Context Window** - 32K+ tokens for complex reasoning

### Usage Patterns:
```python
# Always use structured memory storage
from artemis.memory import store_context, retrieve_context
store_context("project_architecture", architecture_details)
context = retrieve_context("recent_decisions", similarity_threshold=0.8)
```

## 🔧 MCP SERVER INTEGRATION

### Available Tools:
- **artemis-orchestrator** - Multi-agent coordination and workflow management
- **github** - Repository management, issues, PRs, code review
- **filesystem** - File operations, directory traversal, content analysis
- **tavily** - Web search and research capabilities
- **supermemory** - Persistent memory and context storage
- **qdrant-vector** - Semantic search and vector operations
- **redis-memory** - Fast caching and session management
- **lambda-labs** - GPU infrastructure and compute resources
- **pulumi-infrastructure** - Infrastructure as code management
- **postgresql** - Database operations and queries
- **linear** - Project management and issue tracking
- **notion** - Documentation and knowledge management
- **unified-search** - Multi-source search and information retrieval

### Integration Patterns:
```python
# Use MCP tools for external integrations
# Artemis automatically routes to appropriate tools based on task context
# Example: Research → tavily + github, Implementation → filesystem + github
```

## 🔍 QUALITY ASSURANCE & TESTING

### Automated Quality Checks:
- **Security scanning** - Dependency vulnerabilities, code analysis
- **Performance profiling** - Response times, memory usage, bottlenecks
- **Code review automation** - Style, complexity, maintainability
- **Test coverage** - Minimum 80% coverage for critical paths

### Testing Strategy:
- **Unit tests** - Fast, isolated, deterministic
- **Integration tests** - API endpoints, database interactions
- **End-to-end tests** - User workflows, business scenarios
- **Chaos testing** - Failure scenarios, resilience validation

## 💡 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Feature Development:
1. **Research phase** - Use Data Reaper for context gathering
2. **Architecture design** - Chaos Coordinator for strategic planning
3. **Implementation** - Code Enforcer for execution
4. **Testing** - Quality Executioner for validation
5. **Deployment** - Deployment Destroyer for production readiness

### Code Review Process:
- **Automated checks** - Linting, security, performance
- **Peer review** - Architecture, business logic, maintainability
- **Artemis review** - Enterprise standards compliance
- **Final approval** - Deployment readiness assessment

## 🚨 FAILURE HANDLING & RECOVERY

### Failure Philosophy:
- **Fail fast** - Detect issues early in the development cycle
- **Learn faster** - Document failures for future prevention
- **No blame assignment** - Focus on solutions, not fault-finding
- **Dark humor** - Maintain team morale during crisis situations

### Recovery Strategies:
- **Circuit breakers** - Prevent cascade failures
- **Retry logic** - Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Graceful degradation** - Maintain core functionality
- **Monitoring alerts** - Proactive issue detection
