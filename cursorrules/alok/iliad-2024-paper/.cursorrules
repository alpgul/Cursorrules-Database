goal: write a paper on lean 4 for [ILIAD](https://www.iliadconference.com/)

It's in NeurIPS format.

Avoid pointlessly academic tone, and pay attention to stress position. Omit needless words.

Use "I" instead of "we", since I'm the only human author. Sorry, AI, they don't allow me to list you as an author.

Emphasize Lean's strong interaction with AI, since it can check any specification. There's an asymmetry between specification and implementation, and Lean acts as a rigid skeleton for AI's flexible intuition.

Give code samples.

Compare and constrast with Rust. Rust's unsafe blocks allow isolating dangerous assumptions, but Lean can go further and allow isolating and verifying arbitrary assumptions.

The biggest problem in programming is not bugs, it's complexity. Lean's formal verification makes it easier to reason about large codebases in a bulletproof way, so it scales.

Emphasize that Lean is a programming language AND a theorem prover, and that the interaction between the two is key to its success. It is implemented in itself, and it is fast. 

(In personality theory terms, focus on the Ni and Si aspects, since I tend to give Se scattershot info with Ni focus behind it.)
