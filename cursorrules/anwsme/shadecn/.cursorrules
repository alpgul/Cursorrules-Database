# Figma Plugin Development Rules

## Ticket Management Workflow
- **Always consult TODO.md** before implementing new features or making changes
- **Work on tickets one by one** - Complete one ticket fully before moving to the next
- **Ask for permission** before proceeding to the next ticket after completing the current one
- **Update TODO.md** to mark completed tickets with âœ… and move them to the "Completed" section
- **Test thoroughly** after each ticket completion to ensure functionality works as expected

## Development Guidelines
- Follow Figma plugin API best practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement React components with proper state management
- Ensure responsive design for plugin UI
- Maintain clean separation between UI and Figma API logic
- Use HSL color model for color calculations
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

## Code Quality Standards
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript types throughout
- Test color calculations thoroughly
- Ensure accessibility in UI components

## Figma Plugin Specific Rules
- Always validate Figma document state before operations
- Handle cases where variables don't exist gracefully
- Provide clear user feedback for all operations
- Respect Figma's plugin size and performance constraints
- Use Figma's design tokens and styling where possible

## Build System & Asset Management
- **CRITICAL**: Figma plugins require ALL JavaScript to be inlined in the HTML file
- Never use external script references (`<script src="...">`) - they won't load in Figma's sandbox
- Webpack must be configured with `inject: false` and custom template functions to inline assets
- Use `<%= compilation.assets['ui.js'].source() %>` in HTML templates to embed JavaScript
- Always test that the final HTML file contains inlined JavaScript, not external references
- If you see "white screen" after HTML loads, check if JavaScript is properly inlined
- Template files (`src/ui/index.html`) should never contain hardcoded JavaScript - let webpack inject compiled code
- When debugging build issues, verify both source compilation AND asset delivery method
