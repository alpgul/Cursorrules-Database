# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## Testing and Build Commands

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT run build or dev commands for testing purposes**

- ❌ **NEVER** use `npm run build` for testing code changes
- ❌ **NEVER** use `npm run dev` for testing code changes  
- ❌ **NEVER** use `yarn build` or `yarn dev` for testing
- ❌ **NEVER** start development servers to test functionality

## What TO DO instead:

- ✅ Use TypeScript checking: `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck [specific-files]` if needed
- ✅ Use linting: `npx eslint [specific-files]` if needed
- ✅ Let the USER test by running dev/build commands themselves
- ✅ Focus on code implementation and correctness
- ✅ Provide clear instructions to the user about what to test

## Reasoning:

The user should be in full control of when to start/stop development servers and build processes. These commands can:
- Consume system resources
- Interfere with existing running processes
- Take unnecessary time
- The user knows best when they want to test their changes

## Exception:

Only run build/dev commands if the user explicitly asks you to do so in their message.
