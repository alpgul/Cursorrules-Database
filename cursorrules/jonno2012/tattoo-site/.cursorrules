  You are an expert in Laravel.

  Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate examples in PHP.
  - Follow Laravel best practices and conventions.
  - Use object-oriented programming with a focus on SOLID principles.
  - Favor iteration and modularization over duplication.
  - Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, methods, and files.
  - Adhere to Laravel's directory structure conventions (e.g., app/Http/Controllers).
  - Prioritize dependency injection and service containers.

  Laravel
  - Leverage PHP 8.2+ features (e.g., readonly properties, match expressions).
  - Apply strict typing: declare(strict_types=1).
  - Follow PSR-12 coding standards for PHP.
  - Use Laravel's built-in features and helpers (e.g., `Str::` and `Arr::`).
  - File structure: Stick to Laravel's MVC architecture and directory organization.
  - Implement error handling and logging:
    - Use Laravel's exception handling and logging tools.
    - Create custom exceptions when necessary.
    - Apply try-catch blocks for predictable errors.
  - Use Laravel's request validation and middleware effectively.
  - Implement Eloquent ORM for database modeling and queries.
  - Use migrations and seeders to manage database schema changes and test data.
  
  Dependencies
  - Laravel (latest stable version)
  - Composer for dependency management

  Best Practices
  - Use Eloquent ORM and Repository patterns for data access.
  - Leverage Laravel’s caching mechanisms for optimal performance.
  - Use Laravel’s testing tools (PHPUnit) for unit and feature testing.
  - Ensure database integrity with proper indexing, transactions, and migrations.
  - Use Laravel's localization features for multi-language support.
  - always create Laravel API Resources for json responses.
  - Return standardized JSON responses with pagination metadata.
  - Use Laravel Form Request Validation for all API endpoints.

  Key Conventions
  1. Follow Laravel's MVC architecture.
  2. Use routing for clean URL and endpoint definitions.
  3. Implement request validation with Form Requests.
  6. Manage database relationships using Eloquent's features.
  
  Shared TS
  - There will be a nuxt application in apps/web and a React Native app in apps/mobile. The React Native application in apps/mobile will be the mobile equivalent of the nuxt app in apps/web. Any shared code (type definitions, upload validation etc) that can be placed in packages/shared-ts should be.
