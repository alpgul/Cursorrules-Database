# Kirill Markin Website Overview

## Project Setup

This is a Jekyll-based personal website for Kirill Markin. To run locally:

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
2. Run Jekyll: `sudo bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Media Mention Layouts

The website has different article/media mention layout types:

1. **mention-card-text** - Basic text card without thumbnail
2. **mention-card-text-photo** - Card with text and photo/thumbnail
3. **mention-card-featured-horizontal** - Large horizontal featured card with content area at bottom left

### Key Files:

- **_data/media_mentions.yml** - Contains all media mention data entries
- **_includes/media-mentions.html** - Contains the HTML templates for mentions using a case-based structure
- **assets/css/style.scss** - Contains the CSS styling with each card type having independent, self-contained styles

### Media Card Positioning:

- Large cards (positions 0 and 5 in grid) get special styling
- Card type is determined by:
  - Position in the grid
  - Content type (Video content uses featured-horizontal with video icon)
  - Whether it has a thumbnail
  - Any specific render-style specified in the YAML data

### Media Mention Styling:

- Common base styles defined in `.media-mention` class
- Each layout type has completely independent CSS with clear comments
- To override the automatic layout selection, use the `render-style` field in the YAML data:
  ```yaml
  render-style: text-photo  # or text, featured-horizontal
  ```

### Media Assets:

- Thumbnails stored in: `data/articles_thumbnails/`
- Website logos stored in: `data/webstie_logos/`
- **IMPORTANT:** All thumbnails MUST be in 16:9 aspect ratio
- For square images, use: `convert image.png -resize WIDTHxHEIGHT^ -gravity center -extent WIDTHxHEIGHT image-16x9.png`
- Check aspect ratio with: `identify image.png`
