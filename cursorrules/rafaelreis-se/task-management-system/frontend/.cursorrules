# Task Management System - Frontend

## Project Overview
Simple React frontend for task management system. Keep it clean and functional.

## Style Rules
- DO NOT use emojis in code, comments, documentation, scripts, or any project files
- Keep output messages clean and professional without emoji characters

## Stack
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Material UI
- React Router
- Axios
- React Hook Form
- Vite

## Important Rules
DO NOT over-engineer - keep it simple
DO NOT use Redux or complex state management
USE React Context for auth only
USE local state for everything else

## API Endpoints (Backend)

Base: http://localhost:5000/api

Public:
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login

Protected (need JWT token):
- GET /tasks
- POST /tasks
- PUT /tasks/{id}
- DELETE /tasks/{id}

## Code Style

Keep components simple:
- Small, focused components
- Clear prop types
- Use MUI components consistently
- Responsive with MUI Grid
- Handle loading and errors

TypeScript:
- Proper types for API responses
- Avoid `any`
- Interface for props

Forms:
- React Hook Form for validation
- MUI TextField components
- Show validation errors

API:
- Axios with interceptor for JWT
- Store token in localStorage
- Clear on logout
- Handle 401 errors

## What to Build

Pages:
1. Login - email, password, link to register
2. Register - name, email, password
3. Dashboard - task list with create/edit/delete

Components:
- Layout with header
- Task list (cards or table)
- Task form dialog
- Private route wrapper

## Keep It Simple

- No complex patterns
- No unnecessary abstractions
- Focus on working features
- Make it responsive
- Handle errors gracefully

This is an interview project - show clean code and good practices, not fancy architecture.
