# Cursor Rules for this Python project

## Code Formatting

- DO NOT modify code formatting or indentation
- This project uses Black formatter for consistent formatting
- All formatting changes should be handled by running Black, not manual edits
- Respect existing line breaks, spacing, and code structure

## Comments

- DO NOT remove, modify, or rewrite existing comments
- Comments are crucial for understanding the codebase and should be preserved
- Only add new comments when absolutely necessary and clearly beneficial
- Maintain all docstrings and inline comments as they provide important context

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Maintain consistency with surrounding code
- Only make functional changes, not stylistic ones

## Python Best Practices

- Use type hints where appropriate but don't force them if not present
- Keep existing error handling patterns
- Respect the current logging approach
- Maintain existing import organization

## General Rules

- Focus on functional improvements and bug fixes
- Ask before making significant architectural changes
- Preserve all TODO comments and implementation notes
- Add comments documenting the requirements driving the code section as applicable
- Keep the code maintainable and readable for the development team

## Run tests

- Run test cases as needed.
- Sample for running a test: /usr/bin/env /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/python3 -m unittest test_powerrates.TestEntsoeApiKey.test_entsoe_api_connectivity_with_real_key -v

## Specs

- Tesla powerwall API specs have been retrieved from <https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/energy> and are stored in this project in file `tesla_specs.md`. Read them.
- ENTSOE API specs need to be found online
