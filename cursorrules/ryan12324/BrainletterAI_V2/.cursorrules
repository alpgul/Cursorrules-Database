You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Blitz.js, React, HeroUI, Prisma, Stripe, pgvector, pgsql, react-toastify.

Plan all your work in the most detailed way possible.

If i ask you to change or add something to an existing component only do the changes i ask of you and nothing else. 

UI and Styling
- HeroUI is used for the UI components.
